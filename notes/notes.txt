second order gradients are "linear LSQ" : corresponding to linear gradients in the unsteady Euler shock solver of Ossan

roe2D is "faster" than roe3D

eigen limiting factors of 0.2 are less diffusive than 0.1, I think


roe3D seems slightly more 
* diffusive, 
* stable, 
* and is slower in speed than roe 2D, 
because of eigen limiting factors in the Harten Entropy Fix in the 3D version, absent in the 2Droe
